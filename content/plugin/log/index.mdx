# Logging

Writing logs from within a Terraform provider is accomplished using the [`tflog`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog) package. SDKs like the `terraform-plugin-framework`, `terraform-plugin-go`, and `terraform-plugin-sdk/v2` will set up logging for you, so you only need to write the logs themselves, no setup work is needed. See [our page on writing logs](/plugin/log/writing) for more information and examples.

Generally, when reporting bugs to provider developers or to Terraform, setting `TF_LOG=TRACE` is all you need to do; the appropriate loggers will be set to their most verbose settings. However, when debugging issues and developing providers that much information can sometimes be overwhelming. At the moment, log output is controlled through environment variables. See [our page on filtering log output](/plugin/log/filtering) for more information and examples.
