# Filtering Log Output

A lot of different pieces of software are included in a Terraform run: Terraform itself, the SDK or SDKs that providers are built on, and one or more providers. All of these disparate pieces of software can be writing logs, which means that a lot of different logs are being written, and not all of them are always useful in figuring out why something's happening. To help with that, there are various environment variables used to filter log output.

## Valid Levels

Valid levels you can pass to these environment variables are as follows, in order of most verbose to least verbose:

* `TRACE`
* `DEBUG`
* `INFO`
* `WARN`
* `ERROR`
* `OFF` (turns off logs for that logger)

As a special case, `JSON` will output logs in a machine-readable format, though the format is not guaranteed to be stable between releases.

## `TF_LOG`

`TF_LOG` is the main logging environment variable that Terraform supports. It sets the log level for _everything_: Terraform, the SDKs, and all the providers, all at once. It's also a clamp; it's the most verbose log level anything can write as, no matter what their environment variables are.

~> **Note:** when reporting bugs to issue trackers, you almost always want to set `TF_LOG=TRACE` unless the developers ask for something else.

## `TF_LOG_PATH`

`TF_LOG_PATH`, unlike other logging environment variables, doesn't control the verbosity of log output. Instead, it specifies where log output will be written to. Instead of writing everything to your standard error, which is the default and often not the most useful place it can go, `TF_LOG_PATH` accepts a file path that log output will be appended to.

~> **Note:** Terraform will automatically create the file at `TF_LOG_PATH` if necessary, but it _won't_ truncate the file contents if the file already exists. It will just add log output onto the end of the file.

## `TF_LOG_CORE`

The `TF_LOG_CORE` environment variable will set the log level for the Terraform binary itself, excluding providers. `TF_LOG_CORE` only works if `TF_LOG` is not set.

## `TF_LOG_PROVIDER`

The `TF_LOG_PROVIDER` environment variable will set the log level for all Terraform providers that are used during the run. If set, it will act as a clamp, meaning it is the most verbose level of logs that will be reported for any provider or SDK, regardless of if a specific provider, SDK, or subsystem has a more verbose level specified.

## `TF_LOG_PROVIDER_{PROVIDER_NAME}`

The `TF_LOG_PROVIDER_{PROVIDER_NAME}` (where `{PROVIDER_NAME}` is, e.g., `RANDOM` or `AWS` or `GOOGLE_BETA`) environment variable controls log output for that specific provider, _if and only if_ that provider writes its logs using the `tflog` package. Any logs written by the legacy `log.Print*` functions will not be affected by this environment variable.

## `TF_LOG_SDK`

The `TF_LOG_SDK` environment variable controls the log output for the provider SDKs for all providers used in the run. This does not act as a clamp; setting a specific SDK's log level to a more verbose level will override this level for that specific SDK.

This only affects logs written with `terraform-plugin-log`; a large number of logs written by SDKv2 are not yet affected by this environment variable and instead use `TF_LOG` or `TF_LOG_PROVIDER` as their level. We aim to reduce the number of these exceptions over time.

## `TF_LOG_SDK_PROTO`

The `TF_LOG_SDK_PROTO` environment variable controls the log output for logs written by [`terraform-plugin-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go).

## `TF_LOG_SDK_HELPER_SCHEMA`

The `TF_LOG_SDK_HELPER_SCHEMA` environment variable controls the log output for logs written by the `helper/schema` package in [`terraform-plugin-sdk/v2`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/schema). Only logs written by `terraform-plugin-log` are affected by this environment variable, meaning many logs in that package will still have their level determined by `TF_LOG` or `TF_LOG_PROVIDER`. We aim to reduce the number of these exceptions over time.

## `TF_LOG_SDK_MUX`

The `TF_LOG_SDK_MUX` environment variable controls the log output for logs written by the [`terraform-plugin-mux`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-mux) module.

## Testing

When testing, the above environment variables will only control the log output for the provider under test. `TF_LOG_CORE` will do nothing.

Setting `TF_ACC_LOG_PATH` to the path you want log output written to will write all the log output--core, SDKs, and all providers in the run--to the path specified at the `TRACE` level.

Setting `TF_LOG_PATH_MASK` to a file path with a `%s` in the path will write test output to that path, replacing the `%s` with each test's name and writing only that test's output to that file.
